Financing accounts are non-budgetary accounts associated with each
credit program that hold balances, receive payments, and include
cash flows resulting from direct loan obligations or loan guarantee
commitments made on or after Fiscal Year 1992. They are reported to
Treasury via the Government-wide Treasury Account Symbol Adjusted
Trial Balance System (GTAS), but should not be reported to the DATA
Act Broker and are not published by USAspending.gov. Read more about
DATA Act Broker Submission (DABS) requirements in [Section 6030 of the Treasury Financial Manual(TFM)](https://tfm.fiscal.treasury.gov/v1/p2/c600).
