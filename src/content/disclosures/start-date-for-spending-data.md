Federal award data are available on USAspending.gov starting from Fiscal Year 2001. Note that data reporting requirements change over time, and that higher quality data are generally found in more
recent fiscal years. The requirement for publishing federal award data on a single searchable website came from the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA).

Data from federal agency financial account systems (covering both award and non-award spending) are available starting from the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2017 (i.e., January 1, 2017), as required by the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).

Both the FFATA and the DATA Act (which amended the FFATA) are codified in [31 U.S.C. ยง 6101 note](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:31%20section:6101%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title31-section6101)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true).
