As an alternative to aggregate records, redacted records allow for
the removal of personally identifiable information (PII) from
financial assistance award data while preserving the individual
award (as opposed to an aggregate record, which groups multiple
awards together) and most of its data elements.

A recipient name of "REDACTED DUE TO PII" indicates that the
associated financial assistance award was issued to an individual
whose name and other PII were redacted. Along with replacing the
individual's name with "REDACTED DUE TO PII," these records omit
location information that would otherwise be present (e.g., street
address and the last 4 digits of the ZIP code).

For more information about reporting requirements for assistance
awards containing PII, please refer to [Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) Memorandum
M-17-04](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-04.pdf).
