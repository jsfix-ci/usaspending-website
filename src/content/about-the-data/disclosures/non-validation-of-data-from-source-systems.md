USAspending.gov receives data from a variety of government source
systems not operated by the Treasury department, such as the Federal
Procurement Data System (FPDS) and the FFATA Subaward Reporting
System (FSRS). While the DATA Act Broker system does provide some
warnings and errors based on data submitted directly by federal
agencies (i.e., Files A, B, and C, as well as the Financial
Assistance Broker Submission (FABS)), and the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) requires agency Senior Accountable Officials (SAO)
to certify agency submissions on a quarterly basis, USAspending.gov
itself does not validate the data as they are collected on external
source systems. Instead, USAspending.gov relies on the data
validation and internal controls of these source systems. Therefore,
the imported data may not always align with the data standards,
definitions, and requirements established in OMB and Treasury
guidance.

More information about Broker validation rules and SAO certification can be found in the "DAIMS Validation Rules" and "DAIMS Practices and Procedures" links on the [resources page for the USAspending Source and Submission Model](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/data-transparency/resources.html). You can download [all DAIMS documents in this zip file](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/data-transparency/daims-documents-v2.2.zip).
