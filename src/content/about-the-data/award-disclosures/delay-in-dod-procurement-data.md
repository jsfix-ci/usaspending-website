Procurement data (such as for contracts and indefinite delivery
vehicles (IDV)) for the Department of Defense (DOD) and U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE) are published on a 90-day delay in the
[Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS)](https://www.fpds.gov/).
This delay affects the availability of data on USAspending.gov for
these agencies in Files C and D1, but does not affect Files A, B, or
D2. The delay is acknowledged in a [2017 DOD Inspector General
report](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Nov/08/2001839818/-1/-1/1/DODIG-2018-020.PDF).
