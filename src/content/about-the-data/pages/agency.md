Agency Profiles show you snapshots of spending for an agency for
a selected fiscal year. The snapshots cover agency account-level
spending (in the Status of Funds section) and award-level
spending (in the Award Spending section). This feature is
powered by **File A** for budgetary resources data, **File B**
for account-level spending, and **Files D1 and D2** for award
spending.
