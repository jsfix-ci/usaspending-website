File C (Account Breakdown by Award) is part of the package of data submitted to USAspending.gov every month by federal agencies via the DATA Act Broker, as required by the DATA Act. It contains obligation and outlay data for all awards issued by a reporting agency, covering both contract and financial assistance awards over the lifetime of those awards. These spending amounts represent a subset of the account-level spending in File B. Note that File C represents only the financial aspect of awards (e.g., Treasury Account, Program Activity, and Object Class information), whereas Files D1 and D2 provide both financial information and other non-financial details (e.g., recipient and location information).

File C also contains obligations and outlays tagged by Disaster Emergency Fund Codes (DEFC) to track spending from supplemental appropriation bills addressing topics such as COVID-19 relief and infrastructure investment.
