The SF 133 report contains information about overall budget
execution for certain Treasury Accounts within the federal
government, as required by the [Office of Management and Budget's
Circular
A-11](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/a11.pdf).
SF 133 reports are generated based on agency financial data as
submitted to the Governmentwide Treasury Account Symbol Adjusted
Trial Balance System (GTAS) at the Treasury Department. Some
agencies submit financial data directly to GTAS but not to
USAspending.gov. USAspending.gov extracts data from GTAS on a daily
basis for governmentwide spending figures and other purposes. File A
crosswalks with the SF 133 report, though the SF 133 report contains
additional line items not featured in File A.
