File B (Account Breakdown by Program Activity & Object Class) is
part of the package of data submitted to USAspending.gov every month
by federal agencies via the DATA Act Broker, as required by the DATA
Act. It contains obligation and outlay data for all the relevant
Treasury Accounts in a reporting agency, with a breakdown by two
accounting categories called Program Activity and Object Class. It
includes both award and non-award spending (though grouped
together).

File B also contains obligations and outlays tagged by Disaster Emergency Fund Codes (DEFC) to track spending from supplemental appropriation bills addressing topics such as COVID-19 relief and infrastructure investment.
