USDA has identified a reporting issue with outlays which has
impacted its USAspending data. The outlay data is properly reported
in Files A and B, but for File C was unreported. USDA projects that
outlay data will be resolved before July Period 10 reporting begins.
USDA is also investigating a DEFC mapping issue which impacts a
small number of records, and is working to get this resolved as soon
as possible.
