Subaward data for the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) and State
and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) programs are not available
in the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Subaward
Reporting System (FSRS) because this system currently only supports
subgrant reporting for financial assistance, and ERA and SLFRF
awards are direct payments rather than grants. As such, these
subaward data are also not integrated into USAspending subaward
data, since USAspending subaward data are currently sourced
exclusively from FSRS. In consequence and for transparency purposes,
the Department of the Treasury is publishing and updating these data
separately from USAspending, but is including links to them here and
on the USAspending.gov COVID Spending profile page (in the 'Other
Resources' section). These files will be updated as additional data
are collected, with the last updated date noted in the XLSX file.
