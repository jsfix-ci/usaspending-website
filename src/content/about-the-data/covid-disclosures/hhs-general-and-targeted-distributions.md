The USAspending data reflects obligations to a single entity that is
processing payments on behalf of HHS. The full Provider Relief Fund
Public Use File is posted on
<https://taggs.hhs.gov/Coronavirus/Overview>. This Public Use file
is updated weekly and includes payments under the General
Distribution including Medicare, Medicaid/CHIP, Dental, Assisted
Living Facilities, and Behavioral Health/other providers; and
targeted allocations to high impact areas, safety net hospitals,
children's hospitals, rural providers, tribal facilities, and
skilled nursing facilities and nursing homes. Payments are made at
the Tax Identification Number (TIN) organizational level. The Public
Use dataset represents the list of providers who have attested to
receiving one or more payments from the aforementioned allocations
and agreed to Terms and Conditions. Because not all providers (who
in many cases received a payment unsolicited) have yet to attest to
accepting that payment, the totals listed for this program in the
Public Use File are less than those reflected on USAspending.
