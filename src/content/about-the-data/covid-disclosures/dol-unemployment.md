As of June 2020, Labor was not able to report any records to
USAspending showing the geographic distribution of payments made
through the Federal Unemployment Compensation Program from the
Employment and Training Administration. The source file for this
information has been identified; however, creating the file is
complex which required additional time. Labor plans to report this
information, along with July data, in the August reporting period.
