Economic Impact Payments are an advance payment of a new temporary
tax credit that eligible taxpayers can claim on their 2020 return.
Similar to other tax credits and refunds, individual amounts are not
considered financial assistance under the DATA Act that would be
reported on an individual-recipient basis. Total aggregate amounts
related to these payments can be identified by Treasury Account and
program activity. Regarding the Payroll Support Program (CFDA
20.018), in certain cases where multiple affiliated entities were
approved as eligible recipients, only one affiliate or a parent
company is listed.
