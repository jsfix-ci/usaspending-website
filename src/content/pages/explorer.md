Spending Explorer lets you drill down from high-level budget
categories (such as agency, budget function, and object class)
down to the award level. This feature is powered by **File B**
for agency account-level spending, and **File C** for
award-level spending, and **Files D1 and D2** for award
recipient names. Overall total and unreported data calculations
are sourced from the **Governmentwide Treasury Account Symbol
Adjusted Trial Balance System (GTAS)**.
