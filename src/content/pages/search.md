Advanced Search lets you find individual award summaries (in the
Table tab), and also presents summary spending figures for award
transactions based on your selected filters (in the Time, Map,
and Categories tabs). Note that any given award summary is a
roll-up of award transactions with the same award ID. This
feature is powered by **Files D1 and D2** for award spending and
recipient details, **File C** for agency account-level details
such as Treasury Account Symbol (TAS) or Disaster Emergency Fund
Code (DEFC), **File E** for executive compensation data, and
**File F** for subaward data.
