The USAspending data reflects obligations to a single entity that is
processing claims reimbursements on behalf of HHS. The full HRSA
COVID-19 Uninsured Program Public Use File is posted on
<https://taggs.hhs.gov/Coronavirus/Overview>. This file is updated
weekly and represents the list of health care entities who have
agreed to Terms and Conditions and received claims reimbursement for
COVID-19 testing of uninsured individuals and/or treatment for
uninsured individuals with a COVID-19 diagnosis. The file will
include claims reimbursement for COVID-19 vaccine administration
