As identified by DEFCs, COVID-19 response spending data are tracked
starting in April 2020. All federal agencies that submit data to
USAspending.gov must include COVID-19-related DEFC attributes to
their Files B and C submissions starting in June 2020.

Due to the timing of when [Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
Memorandum
M-20-21](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Implementation-Guidance-for-Supplemental-Funding-Provided-in-Response.pdf)
went into effect, awards issued in March 2020 that were funded by the
Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act,
2020 or the Families First Coronavirus Response Act may not be tagged
with a DEFC in USAspending.gov data.
