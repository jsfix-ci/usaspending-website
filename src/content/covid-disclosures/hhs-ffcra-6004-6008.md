Section 6008 of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA)
provides a temporary 6.2 percentage point increase to each
qualifying state and territory's Federal Medical Assistance
Percentage (FMAP) under section 1905(b) of the Social Security Act
(the Act). Section 6004(a)(3)(D) of the FFCRA specifies that the
FMAP is 100 percent for expenditures for covered services provided
to beneficiaries under the new optional eligibility group added at
section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XXIII) of the Act. Additionally, 100
percent match is available for administrative costs related to
providing for such services to such individuals under the state
plan. The federal share of these expenditures are not funded through
a separate Medicaid appropriation. Therefore, CMS is not able to
separately report section 6004 and section 6008 amounts to
USAspending.gov. CMS, however, does have the actual section 6004 and
section 6008 expenditures states report to CMS through the quarterly
Form CMS-64, which is the accounting statement of record. CMS
intends to post these expenditure reports on Medicaid.gov once the
state-reported expenditures are finalized.
