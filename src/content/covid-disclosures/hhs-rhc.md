The USAspending data reflects obligations to a single entity that is
processing payments on behalf of HHS. The full Rural Health Clinic
(RHC) Testing Fund Public Use File is posted on
<https://taggs.hhs.gov/Coronavirus/Overview>. This file is updated
weekly and includes payments to RHCs for COVID-19 testing. Payments
are made at the Tax Identification Number (TIN) organizational
level. This dataset represents the list of providers who have
attested to receiving a payment from the aforementioned allocation
and agreed to the Terms and Conditions. Because not all providers
(who received a payment unsolicited) have yet to attest to accepting
that payment, the totals listed for this program in the Public Use
File are less than those reflected on USAspending.
