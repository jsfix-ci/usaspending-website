File D2 (Award and Awardee Attributes (Financial Assistance))
contains financial assistance data derived from data submitted by
agencies to the Financial Assistance Broker Submission (FABS) module
of the DATA Act Broker. FABS is the database where federal officials
submit transaction-level data for financial assistance awards such
as grants, loans, and direct payments. File D2 contains information
about award transaction obligation, award transaction description,
action date, awarding agency, recipient code, recipient location,
place of performance, and assistance listing, among other details.

New data must be submitted to USAspending.gov every month (for loans) for two weeks (for other assistance award types).
