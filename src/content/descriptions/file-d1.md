File D1 (Award and Awardee Attributes (Procurement)) contains
procurement data derived from the [Federal Procurement Data System
(FPDS)](https://www.fpds.gov/). FPDS is the database where federal
contracting officials submit transaction-level data for contracts
and contract indefinite delivery vehicles (IDV). File D1 contains
information about award transaction obligation, award transaction
description, action date, awarding agency, recipient code, recipient
location, place of performance, industry (NAICS), product or service
(PSC), and type of set aside, among other details.

New data come to USAspending.gov two days after submission to FPDS.
